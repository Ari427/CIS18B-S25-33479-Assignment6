Ticket Reservation System

To use the Ticket Reservation System, open the project folder named "TicketReservationSystem" which has 4 files in Visual Studio Code. Once the folder has been opened, you can click the "Run" button at the top of the editor. The program will run and will randomly select 5 out of 6 customers to recieve a concert ticket. These customers are from a favorite show of mine, Invincible. Hope you enjoy!
